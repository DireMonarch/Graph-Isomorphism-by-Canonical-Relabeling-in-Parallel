# Parallel Canonical Relabeling Prototype

The code in this repository is a class project for Wayne State University CSC 7220 Winter 2025.
The intent of the project is to provide a mechanism for solving Graph Isomorphism in parallel.
The work is based on a simplified version of the *Nauty* algorithm/software package by Brendan McKay.
